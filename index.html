Hello! I’m Prof. Vijay Kovvali, a Research Professor at the Centre for infrastructure, Sustainable Transportation and Urban Planning at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. I lead the MoveSmart Transit and Traffic (MoSTT) lab where our work is dedicated to advancing road safety and harnessing technology, including AI, to address complex mobility challenges in urban and regional contexts.
My professional journey spans over two and a half decades across academia and industry in both the United States and India. I bring a systems-oriented, data-driven perspective to addressing real-world challenges in urban mobility, public transit, and road safety. Prior to joining IISc, I served as Professor of Practice at IIT Delhi, and before that, I led and contributed to a range of impactful transportation initiatives across industry and government. This cross-sector experience has given me a nuanced understanding of how policy, technology, and infrastructure intersect in shaping mobility systems. During my Ph.D. at Texas A&M University, I developed a genetic algorithm–based traffic signal optimization software capable of optimizing both delay and bandwidth—an early demonstration of my interest in applying intelligent systems to complex transportation problems.
